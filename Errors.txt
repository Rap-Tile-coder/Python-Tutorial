Errors are common while you learning a programming language, these kind of errors will make you clever. 
How will you handle this errors?, where is the errors are pointed out?, what are the action do you taken to diminish the errors?; you would learn answers for this questions from the errors you made.

There are many types of programming errors such as Syntax errors, Runtime errors, and Logical errors.

Syntax Error ::  Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language.
 Example : print("Ramu said, "She was absent today due to fever."")

 Runtime Error :: A runtime error is an error that occurs while the program is running. That means the syntax of the program itself is fine. 
                  It is usually caused by something that the programmer did not anticipate.
